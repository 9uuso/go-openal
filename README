There's not nearly enough here to actually play or record
audio, but I hope there will be in a week or so.

I am trying to follow the ideas from my SQLite binding: a
low-level core.go cgo API to wrap away the C-level stuff,
and a more Go-like API on top of that.

If you have any OpenAL experience, please help! Just email
and we can get going. I have no OpenAL experience myself,
so I need all the help I can get. :-D

We can now play some sounds and theoretically we can also
record something, but that's not tested yet. The code is
a mess since I am still in the middle of learning OpenAL.

I am trying to follow the ideas from my SQLite binding: a
low-level core.go cgo API to wrap away the C-level stuff,
and a more Go-like API on top of that.

Actually, scratch that. I am now experimenting with a
different approach, but I won't kill the stuff I did so
far just yet: In the experiment, /pkg/openal will be the
Go-level API while /pkg/openal/al[c|ut] will be exposed
C-level APIs with minimal attempts at using Go the right
way. I hope that this will allow hardcore hackers to go
all the way to the bottom instead of being tied to what
I think a Go-level API should look like. :-D

If you have any OpenAL experience, please help! Just email
and we can get going. I have no OpenAL experience myself,
so I need all the help I can get. :-D
